# Contributing to SchemaCrawler

I really appreciate your interest in SchemaCrawler. At this point, I am not accepting any pull requests or contributions, since I am trying to figure out copyright and/ or patent issues.

Please feel free to file bug reports and enhancement requests, though, and I will do my best to address them quickly.

Thank you.
